how to prove normal equations

proof of regularized normal equations

proof of pseudo-inverse

what if ATA is not invertible, for example, number of features is larger than number of training samples. We can certainly use regularization to make it invertible. But does it mean that we can not find any solution or there are multiple local minimas, for example, in gradient descents
