Recently while taking the stanford machine learning course on logistic regression, it says that the "weird-looking" definition of cost function for logistic regression has some roots in the principle of maximum likelihood. Since I can only vaguely remember that maximum likelihood is related to paramemter estimation, figured out it might be time to visit the topics of maximum likelihood and find out its relation to logistic regression.
