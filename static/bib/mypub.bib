abstract = {We recorded motor cortical activity using highdensity electrocorticogram (ECoG) from three patients during awake craniotomy. Subjects repeatedly executed hand flexion/extension tasks according to auditory instructions. Clear event-related desynchronization (ERD) in beta band (8-32) Hz and event-related synchronization (ERS) in gamma band (60-200) Hz were observed. High frequency band (HFB: 60-200 Hz) activation was found to be more localized compared to low frequency band (LFB: 8-32 Hz) activation in all subjects. Local spatial correlation maps in LFB and HFB were constructed by computing the correlation between channels. Local spatial correlation dropped more in the ERD/ERS areas consistently in two subjects. The results indicate that ERD/ERS patterns are more spatially uncorrelated and denser ECoG electrode is necessary within these areas to map uncorrelated 'sources'. High resolution electrodes might improve both clinical functional mapping and brain machine interface outcomes in the near future.},

abstract = {High density electrocorticogram (ECoG) of motor cortex was recorded during awake surgeries of two subjects with respectively epilepsy and brain tumor. Subjects were asked to execute spontaneous hand movements: extension and flexion during the experiments. We investigated the ECoG in time frequency plane during these hand movements and computed event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) levels of beta (8-32 Hz) and gamma frequency bands. The distribution of ERD and ERS over channels provided an idea about the spatial distribution of the cortical activity within each task. In both subjects, consistently, the scale of power changes in beta and gamma band was larger in hand flexion compared to hand extension. In addition, the spatial distribution of ERD in beta and ERS in gamma band during flexion was larger than extension but highly overlapped between these tasks. Gamma band was more spatially localized than beta band activity and cortical patterns were more distinct between the tasks. Our preliminary results indicate that the high density ECoG can be effectively used in awake surgery for functional mapping.},

abstract = {Grasping is one of the most important hand move- ments performed in daily life and therefore a hand neuro- prosthetic should be able to achieve this function with high accuracy. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) recorded from standard clinical electrodes has been proposed as a potential control signal in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and used to provide information about executed motor activity such as arm movement direction and individual finger movements. Here, we investigate the value of ECoG recorded from human motor cortex with high density electrodes to distinguish between hand flexion and extension in single trial level for a hand neuroprosthetic. Two subjects were asked to execute spontaneous hand extension and flexion during the recording. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) in low-frequency band (LFB: 8-32 Hz) and high-frequency band (HFB: 60-200 Hz) were observed in both subjects during these executed movements. ECoG signal was bandpass filtered in three subbands, alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-32 Hz) and gamma (60-200 Hz) for classification. A common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm fused with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to distinguish between executed movements. In both subjects, the gamma band yielded classification accuracies close to 100{\%}. Alpha and beta bands provided poor classification results with higher latency compared to gamma band. These results suggested that the gamma band spatial patterns of motor cortex captured with high-density ECoG can effectively distinguish between hand extension and flexion. High-density ECoG can be a promising modality to drive a neural prosthetic which can help paralyzed patients to regain crucial daily hand functions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: In this study, we investigate the modification to cortical oscillations of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients by subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).

METHODS:: Spontaneous cortical oscillations of PD patients were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during on and off STN-DBS states. Several features such as average frequency, average power and relative sub-band power in regions of interest were extracted in the frequency domain and these features were correlated with UPDRS III evaluation. The same features were also investigated in PD patients without surgery and healthy controls.

RESULTS:: PD patients without surgery compared to healthy controls had a significantly lower average frequency and an increased average power in 1-48 Hz range in whole cortex. Higher relative power in theta and simultaneous decrease in beta and gamma over temporal and occipital were also observed in PD patients. The UPDRS III rigidity score correlated with the average frequency and with the relative power of beta and gamma in frontal areas. During STN-DBS, the average frequency increased significantly when stimulation was on compared to off state. In addition, the relative power dropped in delta while it rose in beta over the whole cortex. Through the course of stimulation, the UPDRS III rigidity and tremor scores correlated with the relative power of alpha over left parietal.

CONCLUSION:: STN-DBS improves the symptoms of PD by suppressing the synchronization of alpha rhythm in somatomotor region.},
